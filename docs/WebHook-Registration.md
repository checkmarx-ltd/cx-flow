The url/endpoint for all webhook registrations are as follows:
<br>http://cxflow | https://cxflow 
<br>http://cxflow/cx | https://cxflow/cx 
<br>/cx is an applicable context that can be used, but the default / root context will
<br>**Note** replace cxflow with end point/port that you are running the webservice (i.e. localhost:8080)

## <a name="webhook">Namespace WebHooks</a>
WebHooks can be registered at the namespace level (Organization in GitHub, Group within GitLab, Team in Bitbucket).  This will apply the WebHook configuration globally for all Repositories underneath within the hierarchy.

## <a name="github">GitHub</a>
<br>When registering the webhook in GitHub, ensure the application/json Content type is selected.  Form URL Encoded is not supported. 
<br>The secret must be the pre-shared token that the CxFlow webservice is using to validate and authenticate requests.
<br>The supported events are Pull Request, which will by default produce feedback within the pull request itself, and Push Event, which will execute the desired bug tracker implementation. 
<br>Starting with version 1.6.0, Branch or tag deletion events are supported and will delete corresponding projects in CxSAST when scanned branches are deleted (which is frequently done after a pull request is successfully merged).

## <a name="githubapp">GitHub App</a>
<br>CxFlow can be created as a GitHub App.  Follow the GitHub instructions for creating an App [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/developers/apps/creating-a-github-app)
* Make sure the GitHub App points to your CxFlow http endpoint
* Available options for Events are same as WebHook registration mentioned above (Push, Pull, Delete Branch)
* Ensure to download/save the Private key generated for the App
* You must convert the key to PKCS8 formatted PEM using: ```openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in private.pem -out private8.pem```
* To make use of the GitHub App, you must add app-id and app-key-file to your configuration
```
github:
  app-id: XXXXX #This ID will be found in your GitHub App configuration settings
  app-key-file: /path/to/keyfile.pem
  webhook-token: XXXX #Preconfigured WebHook Secret as defined in the GitHub App.
  url: https://github.com
  api-url: https://api.github.com/repos/
  #app-url: https://api.github.com/app/ This is default, only add configuration if using on-prem or non-cloud url
  block-merge: true
  error-merge: true
  cx-summary: true
```

## <a name="gitlab">GitLab</a>
[[/Images/webhookGitLab.png|Example of GitLab webhook registration]]

## <a name="azure">Azure Devops</a>
<br>Azure DevOps requires a different endpoint for Pull and Push events due to the fact the payload and headers cannot be differentiated. 
  * When registering Pull Create Events, use http://<cxflow>/ado/pull 
  * When registering Push Events, use http://<cxflow>/ado/push 
**Note** Only Push/Pull Create events are currently supported. Token should be sent as Basic Authentication Header.

## <a name="bitbucketserver">Bitbucket Server</a>
Similar to cloud, but requires a shared secret field, which is used to sign/authenticate the request.

## <a name="bitbucketcloud">Bitbucket Cloud</a>
Bitbucket cloud does not support a shared key/secret for digitally signing and verifying the request, so we require the token paramater to be passed:
<br> example: http://cxflow?token=XXXXX)
<br>XXXX is the pre-shared token that the CxFlow webservice is using to validate and authenticate requests.
<br>When configuring the API token in CxFlow YML config, the <userid>:<access token> is the expected value.

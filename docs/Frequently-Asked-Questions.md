## <a name="whatiscxflow">Q: What is CxFlow?</a>
CxFlow is a solution that enables creating projects automatically, scans orchestration and facilitates feedback channels in a closed loop mode.

## <a name="benefits">Q: What are the main benefits of CxFlow?</a>
CxFlow aids in incorporating Checkmarx scanning into DevOps/Release pipelines as early as possible.

## <a name="requirements">Q: What are the requirements for CxFlow?</a>
Refer to [Pre-Requisites and Requirements](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Prerequisites-and-Requirements) 

## <a name="issues">Q: When are Issues created from CxFlow into a Defect Tracking system?</a>
Issues are only created when a Push event into a protected branch occurs. When a Pull/Merge Request is created (and CxFlow scans the new code), the vulnerability information is displayed in the Pull/Merge Request comments and does NOT create issues in the defect tracking system.

## <a name="demo">Q: How can I demo CxFlow?</a>
Professional Services has created an easy-to-use CxFlow Demo Instance (sub-project of CxPsPowerHasks) script to assist with easy deployment and demonstration of CxFlow.

## <a name="opensource">Q: Is CxFlow open source?</a>
Yes. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/cx-flow). Connect to preview 
<br>**Note**: CxFlow is a technical solution. Although it is open source and available for anyone to deploy, Checkmarx recommends and supports installations assisted by Checkmarx Professional Services

## <a name="securitytested">Q: Has CxFlow been security tested and scanned for known vulnerabilities?</a>
Yes. CxFlow has undergone multiple test runs at several stages with various testing tools.
For additional information, contact your Checkmarx Representative.

## <a name="featurerequest">Q: If I have an issue / feature request item where can I report it?</a>
CxFlow feature requests and issues should be reported like any other product feature request. CxFlow is available just like any other Checkmarx component.

## <a name="latest">Q: How do I obtain the latest version of CxFlow?</a>
You can find the current release on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/cx-flow/releases).

## <a name="getstarted">Q: How do I get started with CxFlow?</a>
Please see the [Labs](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Labs) page or the quick start on the home page.

## <a name="multiple">Q: How does CxFlow work with multiple GitHub organizations or multiple JIRA projects?</a>
Overrides can be used at the WebHook level and config as code can be added to the individual repos.
<br/>[CxFlow Configuration](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Configuration)
<br/>[Config As Code](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Config-As-Code)

## <a name="singleyaml">Q: Can a single yaml file be used to connect to multiple defect tracking systems?</a>
Yes - with the limitation of one Jira instance.

## <a name="manageprojectcreation">Q: How do you manage the project creation within CxSAST when running CxFlow in WebHook mode?</a>
Overrides can be used to assign the same name to multiple projects.  Alternatively, a groovy script can be used to help decide on project names and if it should be scanned. Refer also to [CxFlow Configuration](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Configuration)

## <a name="globalwebhooks">Q: If using global WebHooks, can specific projects be excluded from scanning?</a>
Yes, this can be performed with overrides & [Config As Code](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Config-As-Code)

## <a name="requirementsfortutorials">Requirements For Tutorials:</a> 
* Create a folder on the C:\ drive called CxFlow
* Into this folder, download the latest CxFlow .jar for JDK8
<br/>https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/releases
<br/>The Java 11 version will have -java11 at the end of the file name 
<br/>**Note** This guide is using CxFlow version 1.6.12, if you download another version, input your version in the command below
* Download the appropriate version of the example application.yml file for your CxSAST version from https://github.com/checkmarx-ts/cicd-examples/tree/master/cxflow/YML-templates

<br/> Under the Checkmarx heading, you should enter your service account's username, password, and confirm the base-url. Under the Source Control heading please enter your token and web-hook token if you have entered a value for the web-token different from this guide's value of 12345. Finally, enter another port if you are using a port other than 8982.  **Note** Each lesson will walk through creating a personal access token in the source control.

* Once the .yml is completely filled out including the personal access token, start CxFlow in webhook mode by opening CMD prompt/shell, navigate to your CxFlow directory (created above) and entering the following, after updating the path\to\CxFlow folder:
```
cd C:\CxFlow
java -jar cx-flow-1.6.19.jar --spring.config.location="<path\to>\CxFlow\application.yml" --web
```

<br/>**Note** The client-secret value included here is the correct value for CxSAST and is not actually a secret value. It is the OIDC client secret used for API login to Checkmarx.

* If following this guide for demo purposes, you can use ngrok to generate a resolvable address for your CxSAST manager. This guide includes ngrok in its examples
    * Download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download and unzip to the CxFlow folder
    * Start ngrok on port 8982 by opening CMD and entering the following command:
```
cd C:\CxFlow
ngrok http 8982
```
## <a name="quickstart">Quick Start</a>
This quick start guide describes how to trigger a CxSAST scan on a Pull Request and a Push to a protected GitHub branch. Pushes to a protected branch will create GitHub Issues from the scan results.

Requirements:
* Create a folder called CxFlow
* Into this folder, download the latest CxFlow .jar for JDK8
<br>https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/releases
<br>**Note** This guide is using CxFlow version 1.5.4, if you download another version, input your version in the command below
* In the folder create a file titled application.yml
* Add the text below to the application.yml file replacing any values enclosed in ###\<\>### with your appropriate value 
<br> Under the Checkmarx heading, you should enter your service account's username, password, and confirm the base-url. Under the GitHub heading please enter your GitHub token and web-hook token if you have entered a value for the web-token different from this guide's value of 12345. Finally, enter another port if you are using a port other than 8982.
<br>**Note** This .yml file is for CxSAST version 8.9. For later versions, navigate to the 9.0 link on the side bar
<br>**Note** The client-secret value included here is the correct value for CxSAST and is not actually a secret value. It is the OIDC client secret used for API login to Checkmarx.

[Back to Tutorials Table of Contents](#tableofcontents)

There are several ways of integrating Checkmarx security scans into GitLab’s ecosystem. This document specifically outlines how to integrate GitLab with Checkmarx’s Containerized CxFlow CLI.
Checkmarx integrates with GitLab, enabling the identification of new security vulnerabilities with proximity to their creation.  GitLab integration triggers Checkmarx scans as defined by the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.  Once a scan is completed, both scan summary information and a link to the Checkmarx Scan Results will be provided.  Both CxSAST and CxSCA are supported within the GitLab integration.

The following steps represent the containerized CxFlow CLI integration flow:
1. GitLab’s CI/CD pipeline is triggered (as defined in the .gitlab-ci.yml file)
2. During the test stage of GitLab’s CI/CD pipeline, Checkmarx’s containerized CxFlow CLI is invoked
3. CxFlow CLI triggers a security scan via the Checkmarx Scan Manager
4. Results can be configured to be displayed with GitLab’s ecosystem or a supported bug tracker via CxFlow YAML configuration
   * a. Results will be within Checkmarx Scan Results within the Checkmarx Manager Server
   * b. Results can be accessed within GitLab’s Merge Request Overview (if the scan was initiated during a Merge Request)
   * c. Results can be accessed within GitLab’s Issues if configured (or can be filtered into external bug tracker tools)
   * d. Results can be accessed within GitLab’s security dashboard, if you have access to it (Gold/Ultimate packages or if your project is public)

` ! Within GitLab, CxFlow CLI will zip the source directory of the repository and send it to the Checkmarx Scan Manager to perform the security scan `
 
##### [Top of Tutorial](#gitlabcicd)
### <a name="gitlabcicdrequirements">Requirements</a>
GitLab can access a running Checkmarx CxSAST Server with an up-to-date Checkmarx license
If performing CxSCA scans, you must have a valid CxSCA license and GitLab must be able to access the CxSCA tenant
To review scan results within GitLab’s Security Dashboard, you need the Gold/Ultimate tier or the GitLab project must be public
  * To review results in the issue management of your choice (i.e. JIRA) configuration is needed in the CxFlow YAML file, please refer to [Bug Tracker documentation](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Bug-Trackers-and-Feedback-Channels)

##### [Top of Tutorial](#gitlabcicd)
### <a name="gitlabcicdvaiables">CI/CD Variables</a>
To allow for easy configuration, it is necessary to create environment variables with GitLab to run the integration.  For more information on GitLab CI/CD variables, visit here: [GitLab: CI/CD - Environment Variables](https://gitlab.com/help/ci/variables/README#gitlab-cicd-environment-variables)
Edit the CI/CD variables under Settings → CI / CD → Variables and add the following variables for a CxSAST and/or CxSCA scan:

###### <a name="configfile">GitLab Configuration File example</a>

The gitlab configuration file is stored at a remote location within the cxflow repo. It can be directly used as a template using the following syntax.

```yaml
include: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/master/templates/gitlab/v1/Checkmarx.gitlab-ci.yml'

```

##### [Top of Tutorial](#gitlabcicd)
### <a name="gitlabpipelineconfiguration">Pipeline Configuration</a>
The GitLab CI/CD pipeline is controlled by a file named ‘.gitlab-ci.yml’ located in the root directory of the project.  Please refer to [GitLab: CI YAML](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html) for more info.

`! It is suggested not to over-pollute your companies already existing '.gitlab-ci.yml' file.  Instead, create a new YAML file in the root directory named ‘.checkmarx.yml’ and include it in ‘.gitlab-ci.yml’`

` # Note that image is a docker container maintained by Checkmarx`
#### .checkmarx.yml (For SAST Scan)
```yaml
include: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/master/templates/gitlab/v1/Checkmarx.gitlab-ci.yml'

variables:
    CX_FLOW_ENABLED_VULNERABILITY_SCANNERS: sast
    CX_TEAM: "/CxServer/MP"
    CHECKMARX_USERNAME: $CX_USERNAME
    CHECKMARX_PASSWORD: $CX_PASSWORD
    CHECKMARX_BASE_URL: $CHECKMARX_SERVER
    CHECKMARX_CLIENT_SECRET: $CHECKMARX_CLIENT_SECRET
  
stages:
  - scan

```

#### .gitlab-ci.yml
```yaml
include: '.checkmarx.yml'

stages:
  - scan

```

##### [Top of Tutorial](#gitlabcicd)
### <a name="gitlabrunpipeline">Run Pipeline and review the results</a>
####Run pipeline
To run a Checkmarx scan, you need to trigger the pipeline.  The trigger is based on the .gitlab-ci.yml and in the provided sample above, it will be triggered on Merge Requests and on changes to the main branch
* For information on triggering a pipeline scan, please refer to [GitLab: triggering a pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/README.html#triggering-a-pipeline)
* For information on Merge Requests, please refer to [GitLab: Merge Requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/)

#### Review results
While the scan results will always be available in the Checkmarx UI, users can also access results within the GitLab ecosystem.  Currently there are three different ways to review results from the scan:
* Merge Request Overview
* GitLab Issues
* Security Dashboard

#### Merge Request Discussion
When you have configured the .gitlab-ci.yml file to scan on merge_requests issues (please refer to [GitLab: Pipelines for Merge Requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/)), a high level report of the Checkmarx scan will be displayed within GitLab Merge Request Overview.  

An example of a Merge Request with a Checkmarx scan report can be found in the below image.
[[/Images/gitlab_merge_request.png]]

#### GitLab Issues
When you have configured the BUG_TRACKER variable to use “GitLab”, CxSAST and CxSCA issues found in Checkmarx will be opened within [GitLab Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/)

For more information on GitLab issues, please refer to GitLab: Issues

An example of Issues created can be found in the below image.

[Back to Tutorials Table of Contents](#tableofcontents)
<br/>
This documentation is to help organizations create and run CxFlow in Azure DevOps (ADO) Pipelines.
<br/>The key features of doing this are:

* Utilize CxFlow as a Stage/Task in ADO Pipelines
* Automatically determine matching variables between the Azure Pipeline and Checkmarx
     * Variables can optionally be statically set by the developer team
* Automatically generating work items from the pipeline if required
* Cross platform Azure DevOps Agent support
    * Docker image for cross organisation updating
    * Updating the image will update all projects configurations
* Ability to create custom workflows for pipelines to run via the endpoint script
    * Run multi-stage CxFlow jobs
<br/>Below are examples of Azure DevOps Pipeline YAML files that use CxFlow to scan the code and create [Work Items](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/work-items/about-work-items?view=azure-devops&tabs=agile-process) with vulnerabilities. CxFlow is invoked with custom workflow(s) that an organization might require.

### <a name="windowsagents">Windows Agents</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)
This Windows based script is called entrypoint.ps1 which is the Powershell script that allows developers to run a wrapper around CxFlow. This can be distributed to all (security focused) Agents in the environment along with the application.yml and the Java archive of CxFlow.
<br/> **Auto-downloader**
<br/> The Powershell script has the ability to download automatically the current release of CxFlow as a Jar off the GitHub Releases. This feature can be disabled in environments that do not allow out-bound connections to the internet or downloading of binaries.

```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  name: Agents
  vmImage: 'CxAgent'

stages:
- stage: Security
  jobs:
  - job: CxFlow
    steps:
    # This will have to be present on the agent
    - task: PowerShell@2
      inputs:
        # Full or Relative path to Powershell script
        filePath: '.\entrypoint.ps1'
```
### <a name="adopipelinedocker">Docker Containers</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)
The docker container version of CxFlow runs the exact same code as the Linux based Agents do. The only primary difference is that you can create a Docker image (container all the code and configuration) in a single binary which is immutable and can be distributed by using Docker Registries.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

stages:
- stage: Security
  jobs:
  - job: CxFlow
    steps:
    # This step might not be needed if Docker is pre installed
    - task: DockerInstaller@0
      inputs:
        dockerVersion: '17.09.0-ce'
    # Run CxFlow
    - bash: docker run -v `pwd`:/code --rm --env-file <(env) organisation/cxflow-azure:latest
      env:
        # Required Settings
        AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN: $(System.AccessToken)
        CHECKMARX_PASSWORD: $(CHECKMARX_PASSWORD)
```
### <a name="adopipelineconfiguration">Configuration</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)
The application.yml is where most of the static settings are stored that do not change. These can be configured per organisation and nothing sensitive should be stored in this file unless encrypted (encrypt them using [Jasypt](http://www.jasypt.org/)).

```yaml
# ...
checkmarx:
  username: ${CHECKMARX_USER}
  password: ${CHECKMARX_PASSWORD}
  client-secret: 014DF517-39D1-4453-B7B3-9930C563627C
  base-url: ${CHECKMARX_URI}
  multi-tenant: false
  scan-preset: ${CHECKMARX_PRESET:Checkmarx Default}
  configuration: Default Configuration
  team: ${CHECKMARX_TEAM:\CxServer\SP\Company}
  preserve-xml: true
  incremental: false

azure:
  token: ${AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN}
  url: ${AZURE_URL}
  api-version: 5.0
  issue-type: issue
  closed-status: Closed
  open-status: Active
  false-positive-label: false-positive
  block-merge: true
```
### <a name="adopipelinenine">When Upgrading to CxSAST v9.0 and above</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)
When updating to CxSAST version 9.0 or above, the REST API changes so CxFlow needs to swap to version 9.0 support and some configuration changes need to be done. This requires the following changes:
<br/>More information can be found on the CxSAST Version 9.0 page

```yaml
# ...
checkmarx:
  version: 9.0  
  client-id: resource_owner_client
  client-secret: 014DF517-39D1-4453-B7B3-9930C563627C
  scope: access_control_api sast_rest_api
  # ...
  team: /CxServer/Checkmarx/CxFlow
```
The Team syntax changes from version 8.9 to 9.0. Originally back-slashes are now forward-slashes.

### <a name="adopipelineenvironmentvariables">Environment Variables</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)

Here is a list the different variables that can be passed into the Docker environment or the endpoint.sh script.

Name | Required? | Description
--------------------|-------------------|----------------------
AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN | Yes | This is the token that is used to clone the repository and open/edit/close Work Items. You can use the Azure System.AccessToken
AZURE_URL| No | This is the URL to the organisation in Azure. Default is System.TeamFoundationCollectionUri
CHECKMARX_URI | Yes | The URL/URI of where Checkmarx is hosted. This can be built in by default by editing the application.yml.
CHECKMARX_USERNAME | Yes | Username of the Checkmarx user (typically a service scanner account)
CHECKMARX_PASSWORD | Yes | Password for the Checkmarx user. This should be a Azure Pipeline Secrets or encrypted using Jasypt (see CXFLOW_KEY section).
CHECKMARX_PROJECT | No | Project name in Checkmarx. The Default is the Azure Project name (Build.Repository.Name). This can work along side the project-script feature of CxFlow.
CHECKMARX_TEAM | No | Project Team that the project should be under. Default \CxServer\SP\Company. This can be built in by default by editing the application.yml. This can work along side the team-script feature of CxFlow.
CHECKMARX_PRESET | No | Project Preset to use. Default is Checkmarx Default
CXFLOW_KEY | No | This key is used for decryption of the tokens or sensitive data using Jasypt. By Default, the application will not decrpt anything.
CXFLOW_KEY_ALGORITHM | No | Custom algorithm you want to use with Jasypt. The default value is PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256.

### <a name="adopipelinescripts">Scripts</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)
These scripts are used on an Azure DevOps Agent as part of a Pipeline. They provide a wrapper around CxFlow to automatically pull out various [built-in Azure Pipeline variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml) to provide a seamless experience for organizations. Many of the variables are dictated based on environment variables passed into the Docker container at run time or the application.yml.
<br/>These can be updated to your requirements and can be different from organization-to-organization.
<br/>The entrypoint.sh script is to support both Linux based agents and it’s the entry point for the Docker image.

### <a name="adopipelinebuilding">Building</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)
**Docker Image**<br/>
We recommend that organizations create a git repository of these files to track changes and easily deploy the images for all pipelines in the organisation in a private registry. 
<br/>Note: This Docker image can be used for any pipelines as long as the ADO variables being supplied are updated to corresponding build systems/bug tracking systems.
<br/>**Command Line Interface**
<br/> In the working directory of the source code, run the following commands:

```shell
# Building the Docker image
docker build -t organisation/cxflow .

# Pushing image to registry
docker push private-registry:5000/organisation/cxflow
```

Feel free to change the name of the image to anything but make sure that the pipelines match the container name.

<br/>**Build CxFlow using an Azure Pipeline**
<br/>If you have created a separate repository in Azure DevOps and use this simple pipeline to build and push the Docker image into an internal registry. This allows for organisations to automatically make updates to CxFlow, commit the changes, build the Docker container and push them to a globally accessible directory.

```yaml
# This Azure Pipeline is for building Docker images using Azure
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  imageName: 'organisation/cxflow-azure'

steps:
- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Login
  inputs:
    command: login
    containerRegistry: dockerRegistryServiceConnection1
- task: Docker@2
  displayName: Build and Push Image
  inputs:
    repository: $(imageName)
    command: 'buildAndPush'
    Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'
```

### <a name="adopipelinewget">Wget Script</a>
##### [Top of Tutorial](#adopipeline)
Alternatively, you can download the CxFlow jar directly from the GitHub release page and run using the shell command below to scan the workspace and open work items.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

stages:
- stage: Security
  jobs:
  - job: CxFlow
    steps:
    - task: CmdLine@2
      inputs:
        script: |
      wget -O cxflow.jar https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/releases/download/1.6.19/cx-flow-1.6.19.jar
      java -version
      whoami
      pwd
      java -jar cxflow.jar --spring.config.location="./application.yml" --project  --cx-project="InsertCheckmarxProjectNameHere" --alt-project="InsertADOProjectNameHere" --namespace="$(System.TeamProject)" --repo-name="$(Build.Repository.Name)" --branch="$(Build.SourceBranchName)"

##### [Top of Tutorial](#batch)

Pre-requisites:

Have a JIRA project ready with the Application and Category custom fields (see previous tutorials)

Have a private GitHub repo (no webhook required)

Be familiar with config-as-code overrides (see previous tutorials)

Goal:

The goal of this workshop is to set up a GitHub Action workflow to leverage the CxFlow GitHub Action in a private GitHub repository to launch a CxSAST scan on code pushes and pull requests on the master branch and create/update issues in JIRA.

GitHub Actions:

“GitHub Actions help you automate your software development workflows in the same place you store code and collaborate on pull requests and issues. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow.”

How does the CxFlow GitHub Action work ?

The action is available on the GitHub marketplace. The source is available here:  

GitHub actions rely on a .yml workflow definition file stored under /.github/workflows.

The action runs CxFlow in a container based on the standard checkmarx/cx-flow available from Docker Hub and uses a basic application.yml file. There are different tags of the action available depending on your version of CxSAST.

By default, the output of the action is a Sarif file for integration into GitHub’s CodeQL (See https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkmarx-cxflow-action).

It is possible to override the default application.yml file from the workflow yml file using the params: field and via the usual cx.config file in the repository.

Step 1: Create a config-as-code override file in your GitHub repo

Since the application.yml provided by the CxFlow GitHub Action doesn’t contain a complete jira section, we have to use a configuration override.

Create a new file named cx.config at the root of your repository (main branch) containing the following (adapt the values with your specific environment details).

{
  "application": "DSVW",
  "branches": ["develop", "main"],
  "bugTracker": "JIRA",
  "jira": {
	"project": "DSVW",
	"issue_type": "Bug",
	"opened_status": ["Open","Reopen"],
	"closed_status": ["Closed","Done"],
	"open_transition": "Reopen Issue",
	"close_transition": "Close Issue",
	"close_transition_field": "resolution",
	"close_transition_value": "Done",
	"priorities": {
	  "High": "High",
	  "Medium": "Medium",
	  "Low": "Low"
	},
	"fields": [
	  {
		"type": "result",
		"name": "application",
		"jira_field_name": "Application",
		"jira_field_type": "label"
	  },
	  {
		"type": "result",
		"name": "category",
		"jira_field_name": "Category",
		"jira_field_type": "label"
	  }
	]
  }
}

Step 2: Create a workflow

In your GitHub repository, click on “Actions”, then “set up a workflow yourself”

In the Marketplace panel, search for “cxflow”

Click on “Checkmarx CxFlow Action”

Select your version (only version v1.0-9.x supports CxSAST 9.x at the moment) and click the icon on the right to copy the action code to your clipboard.

Then on the left panel, replace this section with it:

Correct the indentation. Then enter your details or use GitHub Secrets (setup in your repository’s settings). You must provide more details (including the JIRA connection) via the params: field.

params: --bug-tracker=jira --config=cx.config --repo-name=DSVW --namespace=jbruinaud --branch=main --jira.url=${{secrets.JIRA_URL}} --jira.username=${{secrets.JIRA_USER}} --jira.token=${{secrets.JIRA_TOKEN}

Here is a complete main.yml working example with GitHub Secrets. Notice the top section with the name of the workflow and the triggers configuration and also the bottom parameters.

<br>In the Marketplace panel, search for “cxflow”
[[/Images/gh2.png|Marketplace]]
<br>Click on “Checkmarx CxFlow Action”

<br>Select your version (only version v1.0-9.x supports CxSAST 9.x at the moment) and click the icon on the right to copy the action code to your clipboard.
<br>Then on the left panel, replace this section with it:
[[/Images/gh4.png|Action]]
<br>Correct the indentation. Then enter your details or use GitHub Secrets (setup in your repository’s settings). You must provide more details (including the JIRA connection) via the params: field.
```
params: --bug-tracker=jira --config=cx.config --repo-name=DSVW --namespace=jbruinaud --branch=main --jira.url=${{secrets.JIRA_URL}} --jira.username=${{secrets.JIRA_USER}} --jira.token=${{secrets.JIRA_TOKEN}
```
<br>Here is a complete main.yml working example with GitHub Secrets. Notice the top section with the name of the workflow and the triggers configuration and also the bottom parameters.
```yaml
# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: CxFlow

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Cxflow Action
      - name: Checkmarx CxFlow Action
        # You may pin to the exact commit or the version.
        uses: checkmarx-ts/checkmarx-cxflow-github-action@v1.0-9.x

          # Incremental Scans?
          incremental: true

          # extra parameters
          params: --bug-tracker=jira --config=cx.config --repo-name=DSVW --namespace=jbruinaud --branch=main --jira.url=${{secrets.JIRA_URL}} --jira.username=${{secrets.JIRA_USER}} --jira.token=${{secrets.JIRA_TOKEN}}
```
<br>Click “Start commit” then “Commit new file” to complete the process. This will trigger the workflow automatically since we are committing a new file to the main branch.<br>

[[/Images/gh5.png|Commit]]
### Step 3: Monitor the workflow execution
<br>Click on “Actions”. You will see your workflow execution details, in yellow (in execution), green (succeeded) or red (failed). Click on it.<br>
[[/Images/gh6.png|Monitor]]
<br> Then click on “build”<br>
[[/Images/gh7.png|Build]]
<br> You now can see the execution logs.<br>

### Extra configuration:
<br>Additional parameters (passed via the params: field) can be found in the [Configuration Definitions section](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki#configuration-details).<br>

<br>For example, only process Urgent and Confirmed results by adding this parameter:<br> 
```
--cx-flow.filter-state=Confirmed,Urgent
```

## <a name="IASTintegrations">CxFlow IAST Integration Tutorial</a>
[Back to Table of Contents](#tableofcontents)
### <a name="IASTprerequisites">Prerequisites</a>
<br>The following must be set up:<br>

* CxIAST Management Server (refer to CxIAST Setup Guide and Installing the CxIAST Management Server)
* The application under test (AUT) (refer to Configuring the AUT Environment)  
* Jenkins server (refer to Installing Jenkins) 
* Bug Tracker (refer to Bug Tracker)

### <a name="IASTgeneralprocedures">General Procedure</a>

<br> Create a pipeline in Jenkins that will perform the following:<br>
1. Start CxFlow.
2. Create a scan tag so that CxFLow can identify the scan.
3. Start the AUT with a CxIAST agent.
4. Start an E2E test suite on the AUT.
5. Stop the CxIAST scan and open tickets

### <a name="IASTJenkinsPipeline">Sample Jenkins Pipeline</a>
Following is a description of a sample Jenkins declarative pipeline written in Groovy.
#### Stage 1. Start CxFlow
```
        // 1. Get CxFlow - download CxFlow .jar and save it in a "cx-flow" folder
        stage('Build CxFlow Jar'){
            steps {
                script{
                    dir("cx-flow"){
                        sh "curl https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/releases/download/${CX_FLOW_VERSION}/cx-flow-${CX_FLOW_VERSION}.jar --output cx-flow.jar"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // CxFlow can be used in server mode, or in CLI mode.
        // If used in CLI mode - skip this step.
        // If used in server mode, run it (needs to happen before running the AUT):
        stage('Run CxFlow in server mode'){
            steps{
                script{
                    dir('cx-flow'){
                        sh """
                            JENKINS_NODE_COOKIE=dontKillMe nohup java -jar cx-flow*.jar --spring.config.location=/var/jenkins/CxFlow/application.yml --web&>/tmp/start_app.log &
                        """
                        sleep 30
                    }
                }
            }
        }
```
#### Stage 2. Create a Scan ID Tag
```
        // 2. Create a scan tag so that CxFlow can identify the scan.
        // CxIAST scan is started with the generated scan tag so CxFlow can stop it after tests are finished.

        stage('Generate Scan Tag'){
            steps{
                script{
                    def tag = ""

                    // CxFlow can be used in server mode, or in CLI mode

                    // If CxFlow is in server mode, get a generated scan tag from CxFlow:
                    def response = sh(script: "curl --header \"Content-Type:application/json\" \
                                                    --header \"X-Atlassian-Token:xxxx\" \
                                                    --request POST \
                                                     --data '{\"success\":\"true\",\"message\":\"ok\"}' \
                                                     http://CXFLOW-URL/iast/generate-tag",returnStdout: true)
                    def jsonSlurper = new JsonSlurper(type: JsonParserType.INDEX_OVERLAY)
                    def object = jsonSlurper.parseText(response)
                    tag = object.message

                    // If CxFlow is in CLI mode, generate a scan tag (make sure it's unique)
                    def now = new Date()
                    tag =  now.format("yyMMddHHmmSS", TimeZone.getTimeZone('UTC'))

                    // Used in following steps
                    APP_TAG = tag
                }
            }
        }
```
#### Stage 3. Start the Application Under Test (AUT)
```
        // 3. Start the AUT with a CxIAST agent.
        // This example downloads a Java agent from CxIAST manager, extracts it, and runs WebGoat8 with an agent attached

        stage('Run The App'){
            steps {
                script {
                    sh "curl http://CXIAST-URL/iast/compilation/download/JAVA --output javaagent.zip"
                    sh "unzip javaagent.zip -d javaagent"
                    sh "JENKINS_NODE_COOKIE=dontKillMe nohup java -javaagent:javaagent/cx-launcher.jar -Dcx.appName=WebGoat -DcxScanTag=${APP_TAG} -jar /var/jenkins/webgoat-server-8.0.0.M21.jar --server.address=0.0.0.0 &>/tmp/run_webgoat.log &"
                }
            }
        }
```
#### Stage 4. Start E2E test suite on the AUT
```
        // 4. Start an E2E test suite on the AUT.
        // This example uses jmeter to run tests against WebGoat8

        stage('Run Jmeter'){
            steps{
                script{
                    sh "/var/jenkins/apache-jmeter-5.4.1/bin/jmeter.sh -n -t WebGoat8.jmx"
                }
            }
        }
```
#### Stage 5. Stop the CxIAST scan and open tickets
```
        // 5. Stop the CxIAST scan and open tickets.
        // CxFlow can be used in server mode, or in CLI mode

        stage('Stop Scan - Server mode'){
            steps{
                script{

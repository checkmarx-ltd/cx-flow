CxFlow uses **SpringBoot** and requires using an **application.yml** file to drive the execution. The sections below outlines available properties and when/how they can be used in different execution modes.  In addition, all the SpringBoot configuration rules apply. For additional information on SpringBoot, refer to 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html

To allow for bootstrapping the launch process with various configurations, especially with containers, CxFlows uses overrides on the command line using the `--propery.name=Value` format as well as `PROPERTY_NAME` environment variable overrides.

All the relevant configuration is defined by the **application.yml** file that resides in the same directory as the jar file, or if an explicit configuration override is provided on the command line as follows:

`java -jar cx-flow-<ver>.jar --spring.config.location=/path/to/application.yml`

## <a name="monitoring">Monitoring</a>
CxFlow has Actuator built in and enabled for monitoring purposes:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.2.0.M2/reference/html/production-ready-features.html

## <a name="encryption">Encryption</a>
CxFlow is bundled with support for Jasypt for encrypting property files:
http://www.jasypt.org/

Sample:
https://www.ricston.com/blog/encrypting-properties-in-spring-boot-with-jasypt-spring-boot/

To avoid storing the decryption password in the YAML configuration, invoke CxFlow with the password and the encryption algorithm specified on the command line:

```
java -jar cx-flow-<ver>.jar --jasypt.encryptor.password=passphrase --jasypt.encryptor.algorithm=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
```

If desired, the password can also be specified in the YAML configuration file:

```
jasypt:
  encryptor:
    password: passphrase
    algorithm: PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
```

**NOTE**: Choose the algorithm appropriate for your deployment. This is a sample.
Environment variables can be leveraged for injecting the required jasypt cli values specified above:
```
JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR.PASSWORD=passphrase
JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR.ALGORITHM=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
```
To create encrypted text, use the following command line to produce a base-64 encoded string:
```
java -cp <cx-flow.jar> -Dloader.main=org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI  org.springframework.boot.loader.PropertiesLauncher ivGeneratorClassName=org.jasypt.iv.RandomIvGenerator input="stuff to encrypt goes here" password=passphrase algorithm=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
```
Encrypted values can be assigned to fields in the YAML configuration file using the format **ENC(\<base-64 encoded ciphertext\>)**.  Example:
```
jira:
   token: ENC(r2Q0H31voNvp4NWHQ3bSkNzxmguHnHe/fuA+JiJ6DeOt8Fbzcslm6Hlly78dm6RONSaL8lGywG5atPC0xzyCsA==)
```
## <a name="external">External Scripting</a>
There are places where a custom **groovy** script can be used while executing CxFlow.  These include:
* Deciding which branch is applicable for scanning (Sample script attached to this page)
* The project name to be used
* The team to be used
For additional information, refer to the configuration options below.

| incremental | false | No* | Yes| Yes | Enables support for incremental scan support when CxFlow is triggering scans.  The incremental-num-scans and incremental-threshold values must not be exceeded for the last available full scan criteria. |
| incremental-num-scans | 5 | No* | Yes | Yes (scan only) | The maximum number of scans before a full scan is required |
| project-script |          | No | Yes | Yes | A **groovy** script that can be used for deciding the name of the project to create/use in Checkmarx. This is to allow for any client custom lookups and other integrations.  The script is passed a "**request**" object, which is of type **com.checkmarx.flow.dto.ScanRequest**, and must return **String** represeting the **team name** to be used. If this script is provided, it is used for all decisions associated with the determining project name |
| team-script |            | No | Yes | Yes | A **groovy** script that can be used for deciding the team to use in Checkmarx.  This is to allow for any client custom lookups and other integrations.

### <a name="nine">9.0 Configuration Changes</a>
```
checkmarx:
   version: 9.0
   username: xxxxx
   password: xxxxx
   client-id: resource_owner_client
   client-secret: 014DF517-39D1-4453-B7B3-9930C563627C
   scope: access_control_api sast_rest_api
   base-url: http://cx.local
   multi-tenant: true
   configuration: Default Configuration
   scan-preset: Checkmarx Default
   team: /CxServer/Checkmarx/CxFlow
   url: ${checkmarx.base-url}/cxrestapi
   preserve-xml: true
   incremental: true
   #WSDL Config
   portal-url: ${checkmarx.base-url}/cxwebinterface/Portal/CxWebService.asmx
   #project-script: D:\\tmp\CxProject.groovy
   #team-script: D:\\tmp\CxTeam.groovy
   exclude-files: "*.tst,*.json"
   exclude-folders: ".git/,test/"
```
**Note:**
* Make sure to include **version: 9.0** (or higher) and **scope:  access_control_api sast_rest_api**
* The Team path must include the unix path separator **/**, the path is for example defined as follows: **/CxServer/Checkmarx/CxFlow**

### <a name="filtering">Filtering</a>
Filtering, as specified above, is available on the following criteria:
* **Severity** → Severity from Checkmarx
* **Category** → Vulnerability name within Checkmarx
* **CWE** → CWE value from Checkmarx
* **State** → Urgent | Confirmed
All values are case sensitive as per the output from Checkmarx (i.e. High severity, Stored_XSS, Confirmed)

### <a name="break">Break Build</a>
The configuration can be set or overridden at execution time using the command line (`--cx-flow.break-build=true`) to exit the command line execution flow for a single project result or scan for results that meet the filter criteria.

**Note**:  This does not apply to WebHooks or for batch cli execution (instance and team).  It only works, if one project result is processed.

### <a name="override">Override project settings</a>
The configuration can be set to override project settings with cxflow configuration when triggering new scan for SAST project, or to avoid project setting update if property set to 'false'
```
checkmarx
  ...
  settings-override: true #default false if not provide
```


## <a name="webhook">WebHook Configuration</a>
Each repository type requires its own specific configuration block as defined below.  Each of these have available overrides that can be provided in the form of URL parameters or as a JSON configuration blob that is base64 encoded and provided as a url parameter (override=<XXXXXX>).

WebHook scans are triggered based on the protected branches list. This configuration is under the config block

For **Pull/Merge** - if a request is made to pull/merge code into one of the listed protected branches, CxFlow triggers the scan.  The pull/merge is commented with the filtered findings from Checkmarx. 

For **Push**, the findings are published according to the specified bug-tracker in the main or overridden configuration - i.e. JSON/CSV/XML output or Jira defect.

For additional information, refer to the workflow for [WebHooks](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Workflows).

### <a name="code">WebHook URL Parameters - Code</a>

### <a name="details">WebHook URL Override Parameters - Details</a>
These parameters are related to the WebHook URL parameters above.

| Configuration | Description            |
|---------------|------------------------|
| application   | Override the application name, which is directly linked to Jira and other defect management implementations for tracking purposes. |
| branch        | Override the protected branches that drive the scan.  For multiple branches, simply list the branch multiple times.  i.e. `branch=XXX&branch=YYYY` |
| severity      | Override the severity filters.  For multiple severity simply list multiple times,  i.e. `severity=High&severity=Medium`    |
| cwe           | Override the cwe filters.  For multiple cwe, simply list the cwe multiple times,  i.e. `cwe=89&cwe=79` |
| category      | Override the category filters.  For multiple category, simply list category multiple times,  i.e. `category=Stored_XSS&category=SQL_Injection` |
| project       | Override the project name that will be created/used in Checkmarx.  This allows for greater flexibility for incremental scan relating to pull requests,  i.e. use a standardized pull project name that is always used regardless of the branch - `?project=repo-pull` |
| team          | Override the team within Checkmarx to use/create project under. |
| state         | Override the state filters (Confirmed/Urgent)
| assignee      | Override the assignee  |
| preset        | Override the Checkmarx preset rules for scanning |
| incremental   | Override incremental property to enable/disable incremental scan support |
| exclude-files | Override file exclusions |
| exclude-folders | Override folder exclusions |
| override        | Override a complete **JSON** blob as defined below |
| bug             | Override the default configured bug |
| app-only | This forces Jira issues to be tracked according to the defined application / repo name, as opposed to defining uniqueness per namespace/repo/branch |

**Note**:  Overrides are not required.  You only need it, if you want to override the global configuration specified from the main **application.yml**

## <a name="repository">Repository Configuration Blocks</a>

**Notes**:
All the repository configurations have common elements such as:
* **token** → api token for the repo, to gain access (typically personal access token for a service account)
* **web-token** → CxFlow shared secret to be used when registering the webhook on the repo
* **url** → base url for the repo
* **api-url** → base url for the api endpoints for the repo
* **block-merge** → boolean, determine if merge should be blocked while scan is completing in Checkmarx
* **cx-summary-header** → Pull/Merge Markdown comment header for the Checkmarx Summary, if used
* **cx-summary** → boolean, determine if the base Checkmarx Summary is displayed (unfiltered)
* **flow-summary-header** → Pull/Merge Markdown comment header for the CxFlow Violation Summary, if used
* **flow-summary** →  boolean, determine if the base CxFlow Violation Summary is displayed (filtered)
* **detailed-header** → Pull/Merge Markdown comment header for the CxFlow details, if used
* **detailed** →  boolean, determine if the detailed CxFlow results (vulnerability lines/files are displayed

CxFlow uses **Spring Boot** and for Server Mode, it requires an `application.yml` file to drive the execution. The sections below outlines available properties and when/how they can be used in different execution modes. In addition, all the Spring Boot configuration rules apply. For additional information on Spring Boot, refer to
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html

Command-line arguments and environment variables prevail over values specified in `application.yml` file. To allow for bootstrapping the launch process with various configurations, especially with containers, CxFlow uses overrides on the command line using the `--property.name=Value` format as well as `PROPERTY_NAME` environment variable overrides.

All the relevant configuration is defined by the `application.yml` file that resides in the same directory as the JAR file, or if an explicit configuration override is provided on the command line as follows:

```bash
$ java -jar cx-flow-<version>.jar \
    --spring.config.location=/path/to/application.yml
```

#### <a name="email">E-Mail notifications</a>

```yaml
cx-flow:
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: xxx
    password: xxx
    enabled: true
    notification: true # default is false
    cc: myemail@mycompany.com # comma-separated list of e-mails
```

#### <a name="filtering">Filtering</a>
Filtering, as specified above, is available on the following criteria:

```yaml
cx-flow:
  filter-severity: Medium
  filter-category: Stored_XSS
  filter-cwe: 79
  filter-state: Confirmed
```

* **Severity** → Severity from Checkmarx
* **Category** → Vulnerability name within Checkmarx
* **CWE** → CWE value from Checkmarx
* **State** → Urgent | Confirmed

All values are case-sensitive as per the output from Checkmarx (i.e. High severity, Stored_XSS, Confirmed).

#### <a name="excludezip">Excluding Files from Zip Archive</a>

The `cx-flow.zip-exclude` configuration option instructs CxFlow to exclude specific files when it creates a zip archive.

##### Example
The following option excludes all `.png` files from the archive, as well as all files inside a root-level `.git` directory:

```yaml
cx-flow:
  zip-exclude: \.git/.*, .*\.png
```

##### Details
The meaning and syntax of the `cx-flow.zip-exclude` option are different as opposed to the `checkmarx.exclude-folders` and `checkmarx.exclude-files` options.
* If User want to exclude folders or exclude files, **settings-override** should be true. If user is using CLI they can pass parameter as `--checkmarx.settings-override=true`
* If user is using Github Action value of exclude files or folders should not be in double or single quotes. Example : If user want to exclude folder name abc he should pass parameter as `--checkmarx.exclude-folders=abc` or `--checkmarx.exclude-folders=*abc` or ``--checkmarx.exclude-folders=\*abc*

| Uses regexes                                        | Use wildcards                                          |
| Works locally, before the sources are sent for scan | Work in CxSAST when it already has the sources         |

`cx-flow.zip-exclude` is a comma-separated list. Each of the list items is a regex (not a wildcard). Spaces before and after a comma are ignored.

During zipping, CxFlow checks each file in the target directory against each of the regexes in `cx-flow.zip-exclude`. If there is a match, CxFlow excludes the file from the archive. In this case, when log level is **debug**, CxFlow writes a message to the log having the following format:
```
match: <regex>|<relative_file_path>
```

CxFlow uses relative file path to test the regex match. E.g. if the following file exists:
```   
c:\cxdev\projectsToScan\myproj\bin\internal-dir\exclude-me.txt
```
and we specify this CLI option: `--f="c:\cxdev\projectsToScan\myproj`,

then CxFlow will check the following relative file path against the regexes:
```
bin/internal-dir/exclude-me.txt
```
CxFlow normalizes slashes in the relative path into a forward slash (`/`).

For a file to be excluded, a regex must match the **whole** relative file path. Thus, the `.*` regex expression should be used where necessary.

#### <a name="break">Break Build</a>
The configuration can be set or overridden at execution time using the command line (`--cx-flow.break-build=true`) to exit the command line execution flow for a single project result or scan for results that meet the filter criteria. 

For more details on break build, please refer to [Thresholds and policies](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Thresholds-and-policies#breakbuild) chapter. 

**Note**:  This does not apply to WebHooks or for batch cli execution (instance and team).  It only works, if one project result is processed.

* The Team path must include the unix path separator **/**, the path is for example defined as follows: `/CxServer/Checkmarx/CxFlow`

### <a name="postback">Postback action </a>
On using post back mode, Checkmarx post back action will be added to the Checkmarx project and that action will trigger the /postbackAction endpoint on CxFlow.

```yaml
checkmarx
  ...
  post-action-postback-id: 123456
```
For more details on postback mode, Please refer to [CxSAST Version 9.0](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/CxSAST-Version-9.0#postback) chapter

### <a name="override">Override project settings</a>
The configuration can be set to override project settings with Cxflow configuration when triggering new scan for SAST project, or to avoid project setting update if property set to 'false'.


Defaults value is false, if set to true the projects settings like "scan-preset","post-action-postback-id" are re-written/overridden when each SAST scan is invoked from CxFlow.
```yaml
checkmarx
  ...
  settings-override: true #default false if not provide
```

### <a name="branchproject">Branched Project</a>
A branched project is a child of a base project in CxSAST. Upon initiating a scan from the default branch of a repository, CxSAST creates a base project in the server with name `RepoName-defaultBranchName` and any subsequent scans from the branches of that repository will create child projects off of it with name `RepoName-currentBranchName`. The project count in CxSAST does not increase when a branched project is added. Branching of projects can be enabled by setting the `cx-branch` property to `true`.
```yaml
checkmarx:
  ...
  cx-branch: true #default false if not provided
```

### <a name="scanqueuing"> Scan Queuing and Scan Queuing Timeout</a>
If the number of concurrent scans which can run on CxSAST server is all utilized, then enabling `scan-queuing` will allow CxFlow to keep the event of the scan within itself and let the existing scans finish before sending the new scan event to CxSAST. Cx-flow keeps events with itself for a number of minutes, specified by the `scan-queuing-timeout` parameter, with a default value of **120** minutes.
```yaml
checkmarx:
  ...
  scan-queuing: true
  scan-queuing-timeout: 720 #Amount of time in minutes
```
### <a name="scantimeoutandscanpolling"> Scan Timeout and Scan Polling</a>
The amount of time (in minutes) for which cx-flow will wait for CxSAST scan to finish.If scan is not completed within 120(in minutes) then it will gives Timeout exceeded during scan as error messase.The default value of scanTimeout **120** minutes.
The amount of time (in milliseconds) in which cx-flow pings CxSAST server to get the status of the scan (i.e Queued, Finished or Failed).The default value of scanPolling **20000** miliseconds.
```yaml
checkmarx:
  ...
  scan-timeout: 120 #Amount of time in minutes
  scan-polling: 20000 #Amount of time in miliseconds
```

### <a name="reporttimeoutandreportpolling"> Report Timeout and Report Polling</a>
The amount of time (in milliseconds) for which cx-flow will wait for CxSAST to generate scan report.If report is not generated within  300000(in miliseconds)it will through Timeout exceeded during report generation as error message.The default value of reportTimeout **30000** miliseconds.
The amount of time (in milliseconds) in which cx-flow pings CxSAST server to get the status of the report.The default value of reportPolling **5000** miliseconds.
```yaml
checkmarx:
  ...
  report-timeout: 300000 #Amount of time in miliseconds
  report-polling: 5000 #Amount of time in miliseconds
```

### <a name="emailnotifications"> Checkmarx Email Notifications</a>
If present, this property specifies the email notifications to be sent when a SAST scan is run. Notifications can be sent before a scan starts, after a scan finishes, and when a scan fails. The content of the `email-notifications` property is a map from the following keys to lists of email receipients: `after-scan`, `before-scan`, `failed-scan`.
```yaml
checkmarx:
  ...
  email-notifications:
    after-scan:
      - user1@example.com
      - user2@example.com
    before-scan:
      - user3@example.com
      - user4@example.com
    failed-scan:
      - user5@example.com
      - user6@example.com
```

Email notifications can also be configured via conf-as-code.

## <a name="webhook">WebHook Configuration</a>
Each repository type requires its own specific configuration block as defined below.  Each of these have available overrides that can be provided in the form of URL parameters or as a JSON configuration blob that is base64 encoded and provided as an url parameter (override=<XXXXXX>).

WebHook scans are triggered based on the protected branches list. This configuration is under the config block.

The protected branches list can be provided in the application.yml file under the `cx-flow` section, or it can be provided in the config-as-code file. If branches are provided in `application.yml` as well as config-as-code file then the branches in config-as-code file will override the branches in `application.yml`. If protected branches is not provided in either of the files then CxFlow triggers a scan for Push/Pull/Merge event for all the branches.

For **Pull/Merge**, if a request is made to pull/merge code into one of the listed protected branches, CxFlow triggers the scan. The pull/merge is commented with the filtered findings from Checkmarx.

For **Push**, the findings are published according to the specified bug-tracker in the main or overridden configuration - i.e. JSON/CSV/XML output or Jira defect.

For additional information, refer to the workflow for [WebHooks](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Workflows).

## <a name="repository">Repository Configuration Blocks</a>

**Notes**:
All the repository configurations have common elements such as:

* **token** → api token for the repo, to gain access (typically personal access token for a service account)
* **web-token** → CxFlow shared secret to be used when registering the webhook on the repo
* **url** → base url for the repo
* **api-url** → base url for the api endpoints for the repo
* **block-merge** → boolean, determine if merge should be blocked while scan is completing in Checkmarx
* **cx-summary-header** → Pull/Merge Markdown comment header for the Checkmarx Summary, if used
* **cx-summary** → boolean, determine if the base Checkmarx Summary is displayed (unfiltered)
* **flow-summary-header** → Pull/Merge Markdown comment header for the CxFlow Violation Summary, if used
* **flow-summary** →  boolean, determine if the base CxFlow Violation Summary is displayed (filtered)
* **detailed-header** → Pull/Merge Markdown comment header for the CxFlow details, if used
* **detailed** →  boolean, determine if the detailed CxFlow results (vulnerability lines/files are displayed

## <a name="bugtrackers">Bug Trackers</a>

Refer to the [Bug Tracker documentation](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/Bug-Trackers-and-Feedback-Channels) for a list of all our Bug Trackers and Feedback Channels.

## <a name="encryption">Encryption</a>
CxFlow is bundled with support for Jasypt for encrypting property files:
http://www.jasypt.org/

Sample:
https://www.ricston.com/blog/encrypting-properties-in-spring-boot-with-jasypt-spring-boot/

To avoid storing the decryption password in the YAML configuration, invoke CxFlow with the password and the encryption algorithm specified on the command line:

```bash
$ java -jar cx-flow-<version>.jar \
    --jasypt.encryptor.password=passphrase \
    --jasypt.encryptor.algorithm=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
```

If desired, the password can also be specified in the YAML configuration file:

```yaml
jasypt:
  encryptor:
    password: passphrase
    algorithm: PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
```

**NOTE**: Choose the appropriate algorithm for your deployment. This is a sample.

Environment variables can be leveraged for injecting the required jasypt cli values specified above:

```bash
JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR.PASSWORD=passphrase
JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR.ALGORITHM=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
```

To create encrypted text, use the following command line to produce a base-64 encoded string:

```bash
$ java -cp cx-flow-<version>.jar \
    -Dloader.main=org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI \
    org.springframework.boot.loader.PropertiesLauncher \
    ivGeneratorClassName=org.jasypt.iv.RandomIvGenerator \
    input="stuff to encrypt goes here" \
    password=passphrase \
    algorithm=PBEWITHHMACSHA512ANDAES_256
    
```
Encrypted values can be assigned to fields in the YAML configuration file using the format **ENC(\<base-64 encoded ciphertext\>)**.  Example:
```
jira:
   token: ENC(r2Q0H31voNvp4NWHQ3bSkNzxmguHnHe/fuA+JiJ6DeOt8Fbzcslm6Hlly78dm6RONSaL8lGywG5atPC0xzyCsA==)
```
## <a name="external">External Scripting</a>
There are places where a custom **groovy** script can be used while executing CxFlow.  These include:
* Deciding which branch is applicable for scanning.
* The project name to be used.
* The team to be used.
  
For additional information, refer to the [External Scripting](https://github.com/checkmarx-ltd/cx-flow/wiki/External-Scripts) chapter.

## <a name="outputscanid">SAST Scan ID in Github Action Output variable</a>
If user want to use SAST Scan ID for further usage cx-flow stores SCAN ID in githuab output variable name : **cxflowscanid**

```
- name: Checkmarx CxFlow Action
      id: step1
      uses: cx-flow/checkmarx-cxflow-github-action@v1.6
        project: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
        team: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_TEAMS }}
        checkmarx_url: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_URL }}
        checkmarx_username: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_USERNAME }}
        checkmarx_password: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_PASSWORD }}
        checkmarx_client_secret: ${{ secrets.CHECKMARX_CLIENT_SECRET }}
        scanners: sast
        params: --github --checkmarx.incremental=false --checkmarx.settings-override=true --namespace=${{ github.repository_owner }} --repo-name=${{ github.event.repository.name }} --branch=${{ github.ref_name }} --cx-flow.filter-severity --cx-flow.filter-category --checkmarx.disable-clubbing=true --repo-url=${{ github.event.repository.url }}
   
```
Steps to retrieve SCAN ID**** in output variable -

* Since Scan ID we are getting only after run of cx-flow, So we will use ID of Checkmarx CxFlow Action steps in output variable to fetch SCAN ID 
```
outputs:
      output1: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.cxflowscanid }}
```
* Now SCAN ID is stored in output1 variable which can be used in any jobs as per user convince.

 
**NOTE**: If SAST scan is taking time to scan files and other jobs are stuck due to this so user can run cx-flow in Async mode and with the help of SCAN ID from output variable, User can fetch results.
In This way there is no jobs will be blocked due to processing of cx-flow.

## <a name="awslogs">Streaming CxFlow logs to AWS OpenSearch or ElasticSearch</a>

### Step 1: Create a Logback logging configuration file
Create an XML file named `logback-spring.xml` with a [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html) configuration similar to the XML below:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>

		</layout>
	</appender>

	<appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
		<encoder>
			<pattern>%d{dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36}.%M - %msg%n</pattern>
		</encoder>

Place this file in a location where CxFlow can access it during execution.

### Step 2: CxFlow logging configuration
Remove all logging configuration from the CxFlow configuration YAML file and replace it with this line:

`logging.config: logback-spring.xml`

Provide the full path of the `logback-spring.xml` file.

### Step 3: Configure a Logstash pipeline to tail the CxFlow logs
This example is showing the pipeline configured for the AWS OpenSearch version of Logstash. The ElasticSearch version of Logstash
is configured similarly. Please consult the appropriate Logstash documentation for a configuration that best fits your needs.

The pipeline configuration should look similar to the following example:
```
input {

    file {
        check_archive_validity => true
        path => "/cxflow-logs/*.log"
    }
}


output {

    opensearch {
        hosts => ["https://<your host url here>:443/"] 
        index => "cxflow-logs"
        user => "<username>"
        password => "<password>"
        ecs_compatibility => "disabled"
        ssl_certificate_verification => false
    }
}
```


Adjust the `path` configuration element as appropriate to tail logs where you set the CxFlow logs to be stored in the XML file created in Step 1. The OpenSearch configuration elements will need to be adjusted to fit your appropriate storage requirements for OpenSearch/ElasticSearch.


### Step 4: Start CxFlow and Logstash
If Logstash has been configured correctly, the CxFlow logs will now be tailed and sent to OpenSearch/ElasticSearch.

* We can label SAST issue in GITHUB and GITLAB.If user want to create issue he can pass labels in following way-
```
github:
  webhook-token: 12345
  url: https://github.com
  api-url: https://api.github.com/repos/
  false-positive-label: false-positive
  block-merge: true
  error-merge: true
  max-description-length : 400
  cx-summary: true
  issueslabel:
    high: high,must fix
    medium: Medium,Not critical
    low: ignore
  #max-delay : 3

gitlab:
  webhook-token: 12345
  url: https://gitlab.com
  api-url: https://gitlab.com/api/v4/
  false-positive-label: false-positive
  block-merge: true
  issueslabel:
    high: high,must fix
    medium: Medium,Not critical
    low: ignore
```
* User can also pass this as command line parameter.
```
--gitlab.issueslabel.medium="Medium,Not critical" --gitlab.issueslabel.low="ignore" --gitlab.issueslabel.high="high,must fix" #assigns 2 labels, high and must fix" --gitlab.issueslabel.info="very low"
--github.issueslabel.medium="Medium,Not critical" --github.issueslabel.low="ignore" --github.issueslabel.high="high,must fix" #assigns 2 labels, high and must fix" --github.issueslabel.info="very low"
```

Feature: Scanner project name generation

  Scenario Outline: Project name generation with different values of preserve-project-Name
    Given preserve-project-name is <preserve> and multi-tenant is true
    When scan request arrives with repo-name <repo-name> and branch is 'master'
    Then project name used by scanner is <project-name>

    Examples:
      | preserve | repo-name      | project-name          |
      | false    | ch-eck^ marx@* | ch-eck-marx--master   |
      | true     | ch-eck^ marx@* | ch-eck^ marx@*-master |

  Scenario Outline: Project name generation with different params
    Given multi-tenant is <multi-tenant>
    When scan request arrives with namespace <namespace>, repo-name <repo-name>, branch <branch> and application <application>
    Then project name used by scanner is <project-name>

    Examples:
      | namespace     | repo-name | branch | application           | multi-tenant | project-name                 |
      | checkmarx-ltd | cx-flow   |        | N/A                   | true         | cx-flow                      |
      | checkmarx-ltd | cx-flow   | master | N/A                   | true         | cx-flow-master               |
      | checkmarx-ltd | cx-flow   | master | N/A                   | false        | checkmarx-ltd-cx-flow-master |
      |               |           |        | checkmarx-application | false        | checkmarx-application        |

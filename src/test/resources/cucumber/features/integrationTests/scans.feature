@ScanFeature @IntegrationTest
Feature: Check Integration tests command line functionality - scan. 
# Examples:
# And java -jar cx-flow-1.5.2.jar --scan --github --cx-project="CodeInjection" --repo-url="https://github.com/username/Inj.git"  --namespace="MyNamespace" --app="MyApp" --branch="master" --spring.config.location="C:\MyProjects\cx-flow-runtime\application.yml"

## TODO Should be tested with the following environment types:
# | version |  environmentType |
# |   8.9   |      HTTP        |
# |   8.9   |      HTTPS       |

  @Filters
  Scenario Outline:  retrieve SAST results with the following filters: --filter-severity, --filter-category, --filter-status, --filter-cwe
    Given there is a SAST environment configured and running
    And running a scan for repository "<repoUrl>"
    And filter-severity is "<filter-severity>" and filter-category is "<filter-category>" and filter-cwe "<filter-cwe>" and filter-status "<filter-status>"
    Then output file will contain vulnerabilities <number>
    Examples:
      | repoUrl                                              | filter-severity | filter-category                             | filter-status | filter-cwe | number |

  @TeamAndProjectName
  Scenario Outline:   test which project name will be used or created for scan with parameters: cx-project,branch,repo-name,namespace,app,multi-tenant=false. Using github as a respoiroty.
    Given github repository which contains project CodeInjection
    When project is: "<cx-project>" and branch="<branch>"

    And namespace is: "<namespace>" and application is "<app>"
    And team in application.yml is \CxServer\SP
    And multi-tenant=false
    Then The request sent to SAST reporitory will contain scan result with project name="<OutProjectName>" and team "<teamOut>"

    Examples:
      | cx-project    | branch | repo-name  | namespace   | app   | OutProjectName                | teamOut      |

  @TeamAndProjectName @MultiTenant
  Scenario Outline:  test team name for different scan parameters: cx-project,branch,repo-name,namespace,app,multi-tenant=true. Using github as a respoiroty.

    And repo-name is "<repo-name>" and --repo-url is supplied and --github flag is supplied
    And namespace is: "<namespace>" and application is "<app>"
    And team in application.yml is "<inputTeam>"
    And multi-tenant=true
    Then The request sent to SAST reporitory will contain scan result with project name="<OutProjectName>" and team "<teamOut>"

    Examples:
      | cx-project    | branch | repo-name  | namespace   | app   | inputTeam    | teamOut                  | OutProjectName    |

  @Skip @TeamAndProjectName @File
  Scenario Outline:  test which project name will be used or created for scan with parameters: cx-project,branch,repo-name,namespace,app,multi-tenant. Using file system as a respoiroty.

    Then  SAST output for repository1 will contain high severity vulnerabilities <high1>
    And  and medium vulnerabilities <medium1> and low severity vulnerabilities  <low1>
    Then  SAST output for repository2 will contain high severity vulnerabilities <high2>

  Scenario Outline:  Input Validation for parameters project, team, preset
    Given SAST env running
    When team is: "<team>" and project is: "<project>" and preset is "<preset>" but parameters are invalid

    Given there is a SAST environment configured and running
    When running a scan for repository "<repoUrl>"
    And The request sent to SAST will contain exclude-folder "<exclude-folders>" and exclude files "<exclude-files>"

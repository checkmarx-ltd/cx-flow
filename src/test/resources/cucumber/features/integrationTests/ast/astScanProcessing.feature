@Skip @AstIntegrationTests @IntegrationTest
Feature: Cx-Flow AST Integration permutation tests

  @ASTRemoteRepoScan
  Scenario Outline: using multiple vulnerability scanners
    Given enabled vulnerability scanners are "<scanners>"
    Then scan results contain populated results for all scanners
    And sca finding count will be "<sca_findings>" and ast findings count "<ast_findings>" will be accordingly

    Examples:
    # Cannot rely on an exact number of findings, because it may change after backend version updates.
      | scanners | sca_findings | ast_findings |
      | SCA      | > 0          | 0            |
      | AST      | 0            | > 0          |
      | AST,SCA  | > 0          | > 0          |

  @ASTRemoteRepoScan @InvalidCredentials
  Scenario Outline: Trying to scan with invalid credentials
    When CxFlow tries to start AST scan with the "<client id>" and "<client secret>" credentials
    Then an error will be thrown with the message containing "<message>"
    Examples:
    # <valid-xxx> values are replaced with actual values from the test config.
      | client id          | client secret   | message                           |
      | <valid-client-id>  | my-wrong-secret | unauthorized                      |
      | my-wrong-client-id | <valid-secret>  | unauthorized                      |
      | <valid-client-id>  | <empty>         | AST client secret wasn't provided |
      | <empty>            | <valid-secret>  | AST client ID wasn't provided     |
    
  @ASTRemoteRepoScan @AdditionalFields
  Scenario Outline: validate AST additional fields
    Given enabled vulnerability scanners are "<scanners>"
    Then scan results contain populated results for all scanners
    And each finding will contain AST populated description field
    And finding with the same queryId will have the same description and there will be a unique finding description for each queryId

    Examples:
      | scanners |
      | AST      |
    
  @ASTRemoteRepoScan
  Scenario Outline: AST is not accessible
    When AST scan is initiated with API url: "<url>"
    Then an exception of type "MachinaRuntimeException" will be thrown with the message containing "ast scan failed"
    Examples:
      | url                        |
      | not a url!                 |
      | <sast url>                 |
      | https://example.com        |
      | <ast url>/nonexistent/path |
      | http://192.168.199.200     |

  @AST_JIRA_issue_creation
  Scenario: Publish AST results and check JIRA tickets are getting created
    Given scan initiator is AST
    And bug tracker is JIRA
    When publishing new known unfiltered AST results
    Then new JIRA tickets should be open respectively

  @ASTRemoteRepoScan 
  Scenario Outline: scan multiple initiators
    Given scan initiator list is "<initiators>"
    Then the returned contain populated results for all initiators
    And sca finding count will be "<sca_findings>" and ast findings count "<ast_findings>" will be accordingly

    Examples:
      | initiators | sca_findings | ast_findings |
      | SCA        | 13           | 0            |
      | AST        | 0            | 11           |
      | AST,SCA    | 13           | 11           |

  @ASTRemoteRepoScan
  Scenario Outline: check error message on expired AST token
    Given AST scan with expired token
    Then expired token expected error will be returned "<message>"
    Examples:
      | message      |
      | Unauthorized |
      

  @ASTRemoteRepoScan
  Scenario Outline: check error message when AST is down
    Given AST scan is initiated when AST is not available
    Then unavailable AST server expected error will be returned "<message>"
    Examples:
      | message |

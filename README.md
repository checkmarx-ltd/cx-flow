## WebHook Web Service

**Workflow**

<li>Webhook is registered at the namespace level (aka group, organization) or at the individual project/repository level within GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket using a shared key/token and pointing to the Automation Service
Developer commit's code (PUSH Request)
<li>WebHook fires a request to the Service along with commit details
<li>All developers identified within the commit(s) of a PUSH request are notified via email that the scan has been submitted (note: email can be disabled)
<li>Service determines if the branch is applicable to the service (see Branch details below)
<li>Service creates a new team (if multi-tenant mode is on) and a project for the particular organization/repository within Checkmarx.  If a project already exists with the same name, the existing project is used
<li>Project is set to use specific scanning rules (Preset)
<li>Repository details are updated in the project within Checkmarx
<li>Scan request is submitted for the project in Checkmarx
<li>Service monitors the state of the scan, and waits until it is finished
<li>Once scan is finished, a report is generated and retrieved by the Service
<li>Findings are filtered based on defined criteria (see Filter details below)
<li>Service sends an email notification to all committers that scan is complete
<li>Email includes direct links to issues based on Filtering (optional)
<li>Service publishes findings to defined Bug Tracking tool
<li>Issues are collapsed (multiple issues of the same type in the same file are updated within 1 ticket) - See Bug Tracking details below
<li>Tickets are closed if the issue is remediated on next iteration of scan
<li>Tickets are re-opened in the event an issue is reintroduced
<li>All references within a ticket must be addressed before the Ticket is closed

**Branch**
Branches are applicable to the scanning platform can be specified through global configuration, url parameter overrides, JSON override file (both repository based and Base64 encoded url parameter)

**Filters**
Filters help filter out unwanted issues from making it through to the bug tracking systems.  Filtering can be done by Severity (High, Medium) , Category (XSS, SQL_Injection) and CWE (79, 89) numbers.  Any combination of these can be leveraged.

**Preset**
The preset used within Checkmarx, which defines scanning rules, is set globally but can be overridden by URL parameters or JSON override file 

**Bug Tracking**
Bug tracking systems is specified at a global level and can be one of JIRA, GitHub, GitLab or BitBucket.  In the case of JIRA, you can use a standard bug, or enable an advanced bug that includes additional fields to aid with metrics for application security.  The bug tracking system per project can be overridden by URL parameters or JSON override file.

**Overrides**
Overrides to global configuration are possible through URL parameters or JSON configuration file, which can be loaded from the applicable repository upon scan request or provided as a base64 encoded value within a URL parameter.

See configuration/Override details below

## Override Files
When providing --config override file you can override many elements associated with the bug tracking within Jira.

```json
{
"application": "test app", //WebHook Web Service Only
"branches": ["develop", "master"], //WebHook Web Service Only
"incremental": true, //WebHook Web Service Only
"scan_preset": "Checkmarx Default", //WebHook Web Service Only
"exclude_folders": "tmp/", //WebHook Web Service Only
"exclude_files": "*.tst", //WebHook Web Service Only
"emails": [checkmarx, "xxxx@checkmarx.com"], //Override email addresses if email issue tracking is enabled
 "jira": { //override JIRA specific configurations
"project": "APPSEC", //JIRA project
 "issue_type": "Bug", // JIRA issueType
 "assignee": "admin", // Defaul assignee
 "opened_status": ["Open","Reopen"], //Transitions in JIRA workflow that represent Open status
 "closed_status": ["Closed","Done"], //Transitions in JIRA workflow that represent Closed status
 "open_transition": "Reopen Issue", //Transition to apply to re-open an issue
 "close_transition": "Close Issue", //Transition to apply to close an issue
 "close_transition_field": "resolution", //Transition field if required during closure
 "close_transition_value": "Done", //Transition value if required during closue
 "priorities": { //Override ticket priorities
"High": "High",
 "Medium": "Medium",
 "Low": "Low"
 },
 "fields": [ //JIRA custom field mappings. See field mapping details above
{
"type": "cx", //cx, static, result.
 "name": "xxx",
 "jira_field_name": "xxxx",
 "jira_field_type": "text", //security text | label | single-select | multi-select
 "jira_default_value": "xxx"
 },
 {
"type": "result",
 "name": "xxx",
 "jira_field_name": "xxxx",
 "jira_field_type": "label"
 },
 {
"type": "static",
 "name": "xxx",
 "jira_field_name": "xxxx",
 "jira_field_type": "label",
 "jira_default_value": "xxx"
 }
]
},
 "filters" : { //Override filters used when determining whether a result from Checkmarx will be tracked with a defect
"severity": ["High", "Medium"],
 "cwe": ["79", "89"],
 "category": ["XSS_Reflected", "SQL_Injection"],
 "status": ["New", "Reoccured"],
 "state": ["Urgent", "Confirmed"]
}
}
```
All overrides are optional.  If a value is not provided, the default provided in the application.yml is used.  If a value is provided with an empty attribute, it is overridden as empty.  i.e. if severity is high, medium within the default configuration and an empty filter attribute is provided, it will no long apply any filters ("filters":{})

## Post-back Mode

The default CxFlow mode polls for results until scans are complete, but post-back mode turns the process around and puts CxFlow into an event-drive mode of operation. When using post-back mode a Checkmarx post-back-action will be added to the Checkmarx project and that action will trigger the /postbackAction endpoint on CxFlow. The /postbackAction endpoint will use information contained in the scan results to resume the results handling process.

First, I recommend you configured CxFlow and verify it is working correctly before enabling post-back-action mode. Before you enable post-back mode you need to configure a post-back-action in your Checkmarx instance. Do this by openning settings -> scan settings -> Pre & Post Scan Actions. It is important that you know the database ID for the action that will be used by CxFlow, this is easy to determine if you only create one action because it will be 1. If you have created more then one action or deleted one and created a new one you will need look up the ID directly in the database, but doing that beyond the scope of this guide. This guide assumes you've created only one postback action and that its database ID will be 1. 

Do the following to create the post back action:

1. Click "Create New Action"
2. Name the action whatever you want
3. Set the "command" to cxflow.bat
4. Set the "arguments" to *[XML_output];<your-token>;<your-server-url>/postbackAction*

The *your-token* value needs to match the token value from the cx-flow section of your CxFlow application.yml file. The *your-server-url* value needs to point back to your Checkmarx instance. Now that the post-back-action is configured you need add the post-back scripts to the following folder
  
```batch
  c:\Program Files\Checkmarx\Executables
```
  
The following two scripts need to be added to the Executables folder:

cxflow.bat

```batch
  cd "%~dp0"
  powershell ".\cxflow.ps1" '%1' '%2' '%3'
```

cxflow.ps1

```powershell
  $resultsFile = $args[0]
  $resultsFile >> $logFile
  $token = $args[1]
  $cxURL = $args[2]
  [xml]$report = Get-Content -Path $resultsFile
  $body = @{
    token = $token
    scanComments = $report.CxXMLResults.scanComments
  }
  $cxURL += "/" + $report.CxXMLResults.ScanId
  Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'Post' -Uri $cxURL -Body $body 
```

Once the inital setup is out of the way you can update your CxFlow application file so it looks like this to activate the post-back-action mode:

```yaml
  checkmarx:
    # THIS ENABLES POST BACK "action" MODE
    enable-post-action-monitor: false
    # THIS SPECIFIES THE DB ID OF THE POSTBACK ACTION TO TRIGGER "required"!
    post-action-postback-id: 1
```
If you restart CxFlow post-back-action mode should be enabled.

    void init(ScanRequest request, ScanResults results) throws MachinaException;
    void complete(ScanRequest request, ScanResults results) throws MachinaException;
    String getFalsePositiveLabel() throws MachinaException;
    List<Issue> getIssues(ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    Issue createIssue(ScanResults.XIssue resultIssue, ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    void closeIssue(Issue issue, ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    Issue updateIssue(Issue issue, ScanResults.XIssue resultIssue, ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    String getIssueKey(Issue issue, ScanRequest request);
    String getXIssueKey(ScanResults.XIssue issue, ScanRequest request);
    boolean isIssueClosed(Issue issue);
    boolean isIssueOpened(Issue issue);
* Introduce command line feature to trigger scans (zip) and provide Github Pull Request Feedback

#NOTES:
Must include entries for custom bean implementations under the cx-flow yaml block like the following
cx-flow:
  bug-tracker: CxXml
  bug-tracker-impl:
    - Xml
    - CxXml
    - Json
    - GitLab

bug-tracker-impl are all the available beans.  The beans must match the exact Spring Service bean name exactly.  For example, the following creates a
bean named GitLab, which you can see is listed in bug-tracker-impl above:
...
@Service("GitLab")
public class GitLabIssueTracker implements IssueTracker {
...

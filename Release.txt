Release 1.3.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# FEATURES
* Ability to fail the status of a merge request in GitHub if any of the filter criteria is met (any issues are presented in the pull feedback).
** Following configuration can be enabled under the github block for this:
github:
...
  block-merge: true
...
* Ability to exclude files from being zipped up during the CLI scan process using the cx-flow.zip-exclude cli option, or with the following
  configuration block using csv of regular expressions:
cx-flow:
...
  zip-exclude: .*.json$, bin\/.* #Regular expression CSV
...
* Ability to add a prefix/postfix to both JIRA Issue Summary and Issue Description using the following configurations under the jira block:
jira
...
  issue-prefix: "<PREFIX>-"
  issue-postfix: "-<POSTFIX>"
  description-prefix: "<PRE>-"
  description-postfix: "-<POST>"
...
# FIXES
* Fix parsing issues with the timestamp returned by Checkmarx for the latest full scan.  Checkmarx was inconsistently providing a format that would change.  The
timestamp is now trimmed to exclude the millisecond portion, which was the value
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 1.3.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Changes
* Allow for optional and configurable JIRA comment on updating existing issues
# Features

* Introduced option for Checkmarx Summary, CxFlow Violation Summary, Detailed Summary options for Pull/Merge feedback.
  The header value within the comment is also configurable.  This is to allow greater flexibility as to what is presented in pull/merge comments Optional as per each repo configuration block.  i.e.:
github:
  webhook-token: xxxx
  token: xxxx
  url: https://github.com
  api-url: https://api.github.com/repos/
  false-positive-label: false-positive
  block-merge: true
  cx-summary-header: Checkmarx Scan Summary
  cx-summary: true #default false if not provided
  flow-summary-header: Violation Summary
  flow-summary: true #default true if not provided
  detailed-header: Details
  detailed: true #default true if not provided
* CLI Enhancements
** Allow for git clone scan initiation using --scan option along with --github|gitlab options (NOTE: Bitbucket is not complete, but will be for next release)
** Addition of new bug-tracker option (NONE-WAIT | none-wait), which indicates no feedback channel, but to wait for scan completion.  NOTE: NONE initiates the scan but does not wait for scan completion (async).
** Add global Checkmarx default file/folder exclusions to apply to all projects unless overridden through webhook url param / cli param
checkmarx:
  ...
  exclude-files: "*.jpg, *.gif" #comma separated
  exclude-folders: "node_modules/" #comma separated

# FIXES
* Fix for JiraService bean init failure when jira configuration block is excluded from application.yml
* Exception is now thrown if the team is not found instead of attempting to create project under Id -1
* Checkmarx rest api requires a leading slash for team paths, a leading backslash is added automatically if one is not present

---------------------------------------------------------------------
#FEATURES
* Introduce support for Custom Bug Tracker Implementations. You must create a Service bean and implement the com.checkmarx.flow.custom.IssueTracker interface
    void init(ScanRequest request, ScanResults results) throws MachinaException;
    void complete(ScanRequest request, ScanResults results) throws MachinaException;
    String getFalsePositiveLabel() throws MachinaException;
    List<Issue> getIssues(ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    Issue createIssue(ScanResults.XIssue resultIssue, ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    void closeIssue(Issue issue, ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    Issue updateIssue(Issue issue, ScanResults.XIssue resultIssue, ScanRequest request) throws MachinaException;
    String getIssueKey(Issue issue, ScanRequest request);
    String getXIssueKey(ScanResults.XIssue issue, ScanRequest request);
    boolean isIssueClosed(Issue issue);
    boolean isIssueOpened(Issue issue);
* Introduce command line feature to trigger scans (zip) and provide Github Pull Request Feedback

#NOTES:
Must include entries for custom bean implementations under the cx-flow yaml block like the following
cx-flow:
  bug-tracker: CxXml
  bug-tracker-impl:
    - Xml
    - CxXml
    - Json
    - GitLab

bug-tracker-impl are all the available beans.  The beans must match the exact Spring Service bean name exactly.  For example, the following creates a
bean named GitLab, which you can see is listed in bug-tracker-impl above:
...
@Service("GitLab")
public class GitLabIssueTracker implements IssueTracker {
...

    Number of scans since last previous full scan threshold - default 5
    Number of days since previous full scan threshold - default 7
